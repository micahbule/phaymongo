# Phaymongo
An unofficial simple API client for Paymongo written in PHP

## Installation
`composer require micahbule/phaymongo`

## Usage
Start by importing your desired resource object and create a new instance using public and secret keys. For example, we want to create a payment intent.
```php
<?php

use Paymongo\Phaymongo\PaymentIntent;

function pay() {
    $paymentIntentClient = new PaymentIntent('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY');
    $paymentIntent = $paymentIntentClient->create(100, ['gcash', 'card']);

    // do something with the payment intent
}
```
By default, this returns the actual payment intent data from within the [`data` property](https://developers.paymongo.com/reference/the-payment-method-object) of the response payload.  
If you want your client to return the original response payload, just pass the `unwrap` config with `false` value on the options array when you instantiate the client:
```php
$paymentIntentClient = new PaymentIntent('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', ['unwrap' => false]);
```

The client throws an error if your request fails. You can handle this simply by wrapping it within a `try-catch` block.
```php
use Paymongo\Phaymongo\PaymentIntent;

function pay() {
    try {
        $paymentIntentClient = new PaymentIntent('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY');
        $paymentIntent = $paymentIntentClient->create(100, ['gcash', 'card']);

        // do something with the payment intent
    } catch ($e) {
        /** To get the body of a successful request but failed response, just do the following */
        $body = $e->getResponse()->json();

        // do something with the error
    }
}
```

## API Documentation

## Why?
First, why not? Second, we needed to standardize libraries between several products including:
* [Payments via Paymongo for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-paymongo-payment-gateway/#installation)
* [Paymongo Payments](https://marketplace.magento.com/cyndertech-paymongo-gateway.html) -- ***to be updated***

Plus, it's dev community contribution.

Why Phaymongo? It's PHP + Paymongo. :)
